                    <p>Hi! My name is Amie Jensen, welcome to my portfolio, a peek inisde my journey to becoming a web developer.</p>
                    <p>My path began back in 2017 when I was struggling to find my niche in this world.  I had a bachelors degree, a nack for problem solving, a love for being creative, and stellar communication skills under my belt...what was I to do with them. I began to seek advice from those who knew me best, my family. I come from a family of engineers and programmers, and thats when my father lovingly nudged me in the direction of progamming...and I'm happy to say I haven't looked back!</p>
                    <p>Web programming has pushed me mentally in such a good way, it has opened up a new side of me I never knew existed.  I love how I am continually learning and keeping up to date with all that web development has to offer.</p>
                    <p>My plan is to keep programming, keep learning and growing and one day have to privilage to code with team where I can really put my skills to the test! Everyone's path in life is different I am glad I have found my passion and can continue on this Journey! Enjoy!</p>
