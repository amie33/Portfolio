                    <p>Hi! My name is Amie Jensen, welcome to my portfolio, a peek inisde my journey to becoming a web developer.</p>
                    <p>My path began back in 2017 when I was struggling to find my niche in this world.  I had a bachelors degree, a nack for problem solving, a love for being creative, and stellar communication skills under my belt...what was I to do with them. I began to seek advice from those who knew me best, my family. I come from a family of engineers and programmers, and thats when my father lovingly nudged me in the direction of progamming...and I'm happy to say I haven't looked back!</p>
                    <p>Web programming has pushed me mentally in such a good way, it has opened up a new side of me I never knew existed.  I love how I am continually learning and keeping up to date with all that web development has to offer.</p>
                    <p>My plan is to keep programming, keep learning and growing and one day have to privilage to code with team where I can really put my skills to the test! Everyone's path in life is different I am glad I have found my passion and can continue on this Journey! Enjoy!</p>

                <p id="paraProjects">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
